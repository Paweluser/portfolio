          Hi, my name is Pawe≈Ç and for the past two years I have been exploring
          the world of frontend with great dedication. For me, web programming
          is more than just learning - it is a passion that gives me great
          satisfaction and a sense of continuous development. I systematically
          expand my knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          and modern frameworks, because I believe that there is always
          something new to discover in this field. For me, frontend has become
          one of the few areas that I really put my whole heart into - I don't
          just learn theory, but also create my own projects, experiment with
          new solutions and try to develop both my technical skills and my sense
          of aesthetics. I hope you find this place inspiring and that you find
          something to enjoy here - be it knowledge, an idea or maybe even
          motivation for your own actions. Have fun and make yourself
          comfortable! ^^
